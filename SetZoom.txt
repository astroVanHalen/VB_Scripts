' Purpose: This macro will reset the zoom to a specified value and move the focus to cell A1
'	for each sheet in a workbook then reset the active sheet to the first sheet in the book
' Usage: Use this once a document is complete to tidy up and give a more professional experience
' Notes: When this macro is run, the user is prompted for a zoom level.  I typically use 85 if
'	there are sheets with screenshots, 100 otherwise
